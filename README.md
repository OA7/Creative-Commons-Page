# Microverse Capstone Project
The aim of this project is putting the student in a real life situation where they are given a real-world-like project with specifications and a time duration to convert those specifications into a functional product.
<br>
My project was to replicate the Creative Commons 2015 Global Summit Conference site. I was tasked to build the a minimum of 3 pages at two different screen sizes :
- Mobile up to 768px
- Desktop from 768px and bigger.


## Screenshots for various screen sizes
